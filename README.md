My tello clone:
   <br> 1.Add New taks to Todo Column by clicking the top button. 
   <br> 2.You can assign tasks to diffrent users and select diffrent color lables for them. User-list hard coded.
   <br> 3.Click on the card to open and add comments on it. 
   <br> 4.Can tag multiple users in the comment.
   <br> 5.Drag the cards around to change there status.

Currently local-storage is used to make the data persistent. Can be easily replaced by actual backed api. Need to change only api.js.
