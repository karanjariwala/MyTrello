Live Project see here https://karanjariwala.github.io/MyTrello/ 

My tello clone:
    1.Add New taks to Todo Column by clicking the top button. 
    2.You can assign tasks to diffrent users. 
    3.Click on the card to open and add comments on it 
    4.Drag the cards around to change there status.

Currently local-storage is used to make the data persistent. Can be easily replaced by actual backed api. Need to change only api.js.
